# Version Control Systems

Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help developers manage changes to source code over time. They allow for tracking of revisions, collaboration among developers, and easy rollback to previous versions of code. There are two main types of version control systems:

### 1. **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**
- **Examples**:
  - **Subversion (SVN)**: A popular centralized version control system.
  - **CVS (Concurrent Versions System)**: An older version control system that was used before Git became widely adopted.

### 2. **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**
- **Examples**:
  - **Git**: The most widely used distributed version control system today.
  - **Mercurial**: Another distributed version control system, though less popular than Git.
  - **Bazaar**: A version control system that supports both centralized and decentralized workflows.

### Most Popular Version Control Systems
---
**1. **Git** (Distributed)**
   - **Features**: Branching, merging, stashing, rebasing, distributed architecture, powerful command line tools.
   - **Popular Platforms**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.

**2. **Subversion (SVN)** (Centralized)**
   - **Features**: Centralized repository, versioning, branching, and merging.
   - **Popular Platforms**: Apache Subversion.

**3. **Mercurial** (Distributed)**
   - **Features**: Distributed system, simplicity, branching and merging.
   - **Popular Platforms**: Bitbucket (supports both Git and Mercurial).

**4. **Perforce Helix Core** (Centralized/Distributed)**
   - **Features**: High performance, versioning of large files (e.g., game assets), scalable.
   - **Popular Platforms**: Perforce.

### Conclusion
Version control systems are essential tools for modern software development, allowing teams to collaborate effectively, maintain code quality, and manage project histories. Git remains the most popular system, but there are alternatives like SVN, Mercurial, and Perforce, each suited to different workflows and requirements.
