# Welcome to the Python Data Types Guide

Welcome to the Python Data Types Guide! This comprehensive resource will help you understand the various data types available in Python and how to use them effectively in your programming tasks. Mastering data types is essential for building robust applications, as they dictate how data is stored, manipulated, and processed.

## Contents

1. [**Numbers**](number.md)  
   Explore the different types of numeric data in Python, including integers, floats, and complex numbers. This section covers how to perform mathematical operations on these data types and highlights their characteristics.

2. [**Strings**](string.md)  
   Delve into strings, the fundamental data type for representing text in Python. This section explains how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on strings, including escaping characters and string concatenation.

3. [**String Formatting**](string_formatter.md)  
   Learn about various methods for formatting strings in Python, including f-strings, the `format()` method, and the older `%` formatting. This section provides examples to help you present data clearly and dynamically.

4. [**String Methods**](string_methods.md)  
   Discover the built-in string methods available in Python, such as `upper()`, `lower()`, `replace()`, and many others. This section includes practical examples demonstrating how to use these methods to manipulate and analyze strings effectively.

5. [**List**](list.md)  
   Understand lists, one of the most versatile data types in Python. This section covers how to create and manipulate lists, including adding, removing, and accessing elements, as well as the characteristics that make lists powerful.

6. [**List Comprehension**](list_comprehension.md)  
   Explore list comprehension, a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. This section provides examples of how to write and use list comprehensions to simplify your code and improve readability.

7. [**Dictionary**](dictionary.md)  
   Learn about dictionaries, a powerful data type for storing key-value pairs in Python. This section covers how to create, access, and manipulate dictionaries, including common methods and use cases.

8. [**Tuple**](tuple.md)  
   Discover tuples, an immutable data type in Python. This section explains how to create and use tuples, highlighting their advantages and scenarios where they are preferable to lists.

9. [**Set**](set.md)  
   Explore sets, a data type that stores unique elements. This section covers how to create and manipulate sets, including their properties and applications in eliminating duplicates.

10. [**Set Operations**](set_operations.md)  
    Delve into set operations, including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. This section provides examples to illustrate how to perform these operations and utilize sets effectively in your code.
