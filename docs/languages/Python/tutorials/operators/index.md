# Welcome to Python Operators Notes

Welcome to the Python Operators Notes! This resource provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of operators available in Python, which are essential for performing various operations in your code. Understanding operators and their usage is crucial for writing efficient and effective Python programs, whether you're performing mathematical calculations, manipulating data, or controlling program flow.

## Contents

1. [**Mathematical Operators**](math.md)  
   Dive into the world of mathematical operators in Python, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. This section covers how to use these operators for performing arithmetic calculations, as well as their behavior with different data types.

2. [**Bitwise Operators**](bitwise.md)  
   Explore bitwise operators that allow you to perform operations on binary representations of integers. This section discusses AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shift operators, providing examples and explanations of their use cases in low-level programming tasks.

3. [**Boolean Operators**](boolean.md)  
   Understand the logical operations available in Python, such as AND, OR, and NOT. This section explains how to use Boolean operators for evaluating conditions, combining multiple expressions, and controlling the flow of your programs based on logical conditions.

4. [**Operator Precedence**](operator_precedence.md)  
   Learn about operator precedence and associativity rules in Python, which determine the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. This section includes examples to illustrate how precedence affects the results of complex expressions and how to use parentheses to override default behavior.
