# Welcome to the Python Data Structures Guide

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Guide! This resource provides a detailed exploration of essential data structures that are foundational for organizing and storing data in Python. Understanding these structures is crucial for efficient data management and algorithm implementation, enabling you to write more effective and performant code.

## Contents

1. [**Arrays**](arrays.md)  
   Discover arrays, a fundamental data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. This section covers how to create and manipulate arrays in Python, including indexing, slicing, and common operations to efficiently manage collections of data.

2. [**Linked List**](linked_list.md)  
   Explore linked lists, a dynamic data structure consisting of nodes where each node points to the next. This section discusses the advantages of linked lists over arrays, how to create, traverse, and manipulate linked lists, and the various types, such as singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
